# ML Curious Git Workshop: Collaboration Repository

Welcome to the Git Collaboration exercise.

In this repository we will practice:
- Cloning a remote repository
- Creating branches
- Making changes
- Solving merge conflicts
- Using `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/isabelahm/Git-Collaboration-Demo.git
cd workshop-repo
```
2. Create a new branch with your name:
```
git checkout -b <yourname>-branch
```
3. Edit one of the files:

    Add your name to participants.txt

    OR make a small change in script.py

4. Commit and push your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added my name / made my changes"
git push origin <yourname>-branch
```

Later, we will merge branches and handle conflicts together!
